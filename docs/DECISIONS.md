# Architecture Decision Log

## ADR-0001: Final native mode contains no runtime MIPS interpreter/JIT

Status: Accepted

Reason: this is the defining product goal. Instrumented emulation/dynarec execution is allowed during analysis and verification only.

## ADR-0002: Rust is the default language for project-owned code

Status: Accepted for bootstrap

Reason: memory safety, explicit data modeling, tooling, and suitability for binary-analysis/compiler infrastructure. This is not a performance claim over C++.

## ADR-0003: Reference implementations are pinned and kept out of the repository

Status: Accepted

Reason: reproducibility, license separation, and reduced repository noise.

## ADR-0004: No project license selected yet

Status: Open

Reason: dependency/reuse strategy is not final. Select a license only after deciding whether code from GPL projects will be incorporated or merely used as reference/oracles.

## ADR-0005: Ordered ProgramMap collections and versioned NDJSON traces

Status: Accepted, 2026-10-08.

ProgramMap v0 uses ordered sets/maps. Structured execution keys serialize as
sorted pair arrays, with duplicate keys rejected. Guest code identity includes
image and generation. Mupen compilation units remain distinct from basic blocks.
Trace v0 includes contiguous sequences and a mandatory end record: truncated
output is an error, not a successful discovery session. Invalidation includes a
separate global form. Target lookup and source-correlated indirect observation
are different events; neither finite samples nor installed entries prove closure.

## ADR-0006: Keep Mupen instrumentation in a separate GPL research patch

Status: Accepted, 2026-10-08.

Inspected pinned Mupen `LICENSES` and `new_dynarec.c` notices (GPL-2.0-or-later
for the instrumented file). The patch and sink are a GPL research instrument.
No Mupen implementation is copied into or linked with plaid-core. The wire
format is the boundary. Plaid's overall project license remains undecided.
