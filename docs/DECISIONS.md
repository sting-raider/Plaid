# Architecture Decision Log

## ADR-0001: Final native mode contains no runtime MIPS interpreter/JIT

Status: Accepted

Reason: this is the defining product goal. Instrumented emulation/dynarec execution is allowed during analysis and verification only.

## ADR-0002: Rust is the default language for project-owned code

Status: Accepted for bootstrap

Reason: memory safety, explicit data modeling, tooling, and suitability for binary-analysis/compiler infrastructure. This is not a performance claim over C++.

## ADR-0003: Reference implementations are pinned and kept out of the repository

Status: Accepted

Reason: reproducibility, license separation, and reduced repository noise.

## ADR-0004: No project license selected yet

Status: Open

Reason: dependency/reuse strategy is not final. Select a license only after deciding whether code from GPL projects will be incorporated or merely used as reference/oracles.
